This is a simple integration mod, adding support for MineColonies and/or Domum Ornamentum to Jade.  See the CurseForge page for more information on features.

## For Players

The mod can be downloaded from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jadecolonies) and installed like any other mod.

## For Developers

#### Building

It builds using gradle/gradlew, like most other mods.  There are no special steps.

#### Maven

I'm not currently expecting there would be any reason for someone to base another mod on top of this one, so I haven't published any API or Maven repository.  Let me know if you think there might be some reason to. 

## Contributions

Language files in particular are very welcome -- submit a Pull Request with the new files or other changes.  You can see a list of existing translations [here](src/main/resources/assets/jadecolonies/lang).

Other suggestions, bug reports, and pull requests are also welcome, but please do your research first!

## Credits

Special thanks to the Jade and MineColonies authors, of course, without whom this mod would be pointless.
